# Executing tests

## Running all Tests for a Product

Execute this command **from the root of the project!**

```bash
./shell/run-all-b2b-mp-performance-tests.sh
```

 It is important to execute it from the root! If not the paths in the scripts will break.

This bash script will find all test files in all products and then execute them one after another.
